<p>On May 28, 2020, Jonathan Batiste and friends gathered at McKittrick Hotel’s Cafe and Bar to celebrate Batiste’s 33rd birthday. The “party” happened at midday. It was free for all and it was open to all. And how did they celebrate? By doing what Batiste loves most: playing jazz.</p>

<p>The concert was an hour long, featuring pieces from Batiste’s albums, “Chronology of a Dream” and “Anatomy of Angels”. He began with a funky take on “If You’re Happy and You Know It”, one that would set the tone for the rest of his birthday celebration. During this song, Batiste contributed improvisational vocals, repeating the lyric, “Iko, iko, un-day/ Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-né”—a Mardi Gras classic. And indeed what followed after this song was more soulful and ebullient jazz playing that brought a rich Mardi Gras celebration from Batiste’s hometown of New Orleans to that small bar in New York.</p>

<p>Although I have no technical knowledge in music theory, I would say that this concert is Jazz. First, I diverge to say that I consider Jazz a genre and language–one that simply doesn’t use words. As I once heard a friend say,  “Ultimately, Jazz is really a language. Jazz music has a certain syntax and structure...with frequent key changes, commonly used scales, chromaticism, syncopation and polyrhythms, similar melodic phrasing, certain common progressions, similarities in song structure, and more.” And so I classify Jazz as music that communicates through its “syntax and structure”, of course with the usual swing, syncopation, and improvisation. I have found that Jazz is the only type of music that communicates stories and feelings to me without the more literal communication of lyrics and singing. In this concert, Batiste and company did indeed communicate joy through happy harmonic progressions and many improvised solos through what I would consider Jazz. In the comments for the livestream, many praised the “conscious stream of improvisation”, which was heard in most of the playing. Others also regarded the set as “the future of avant-garde Jazz” that featured integrations of “R&B, Funk, Soul, and Blues” which “encouraged, comforted, and cheered” the soul. All of this to say that the resulting sound of the band closely followed Jazz traditions of great freedom of expression and exploration with sound (Youtube).</p>

<p>I would also say that the music is African-American as the performance pays homage to Batiste’s New Orleans roots. As a birthday gathering, it was fitting that Batiste celebrated his hometown by featuring Mardi Gras sound and energy in his music. I would guess that New Orleans most definitely played a part in forming his love for Jazz music, as anyone comes to learn that New Orleans was the birthplace of Jazz. In addition, many of the styles that Batiste and his band played that day were those that were largely developed by African-Americans (“R&B, Funk, Soul, and Blues”). Even if played by people of different races or ethnicities, this music will always have its roots in African-American culture.</p>

<p>Though the main composition of an audience member was a POC, young adult, casually dressed, and most likely middle-class, all types of people were there to enjoy the performance. It was not catered to one demographic. As Batiste let it, the celebration was open to anyone and made available online. As the livestream cut to wide angles of the audience, one could see the diverse makeup of the crowd, a reflection of New York’s own diverse population. You could spot a woman dressed in formal attire and a man donning a simple graphic tee and jeans. You could spot a young adult sitting next to an elder, while both swung to the swing of the band. And by virtue of being a free performance, this experience was not made for one single class. While music languages like Classical, Hip-Hop, or Rock tend to be more niche and its audiences also, Batiste spreads happiness through his jazz, and happiness is something that is universal—it’s for everyone to feel.</p>

<p>For his birthday celebration, Batiste shared the joys of 33 years of life in a language that speaks to all, and in a language that he knows extremely well- the language of Jazz.</p>
